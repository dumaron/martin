# Martin

Martin is a personal software to help me be the best version of myself.
Personal software means that, unlike conventional software which aims at solving a small set of problems for many users,
Martinh aims at solving many problems for a single user – myself.

Martin tries to reach its goal by helping me in these areas:
- **Break from dailiness**: a volte la quotidianità può essere opprimente. Ci sono giorni in cui le azioni di ogni giorno
mi 
- **Checking my finances**: having a feeling of control over my money triggers feelings of calmness and trust. Just knowing
  I can always see how much I spend, in which categories, and that there will be guardrails in place to prevent me from
  going bankrupt is of great relief.
