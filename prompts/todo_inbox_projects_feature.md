Good evening, Claude.

Now I want you to implement, in a git branch called `gtd`, a primitive GTD-like system.
I want you to implement it in the current django project, following its conventions and peculiarities.
Please have a deep look of the current version of the code, cloned from `main` branch, to understand how it works.

Now, please implement the following features:
- [ ] Create a new project
- [ ] List all projects
- [ ] Add a new task to a project
- [ ] List all tasks of a project
- [ ] Mark a task as done
- [ ] Mark a project as archived, done, suspended, active
- [ ] Create inboxes

All the pages to access these features need to be listed under the "low-level entitie" menu in the sidebar.

For the possible attributes and statuses of projects, tasks and inboxes, try to use your previous knowledge about GTD.

After that, please add a new "flow" page that shows the oldest non processed inbox, and allows to process it.

Do your best, but don't hesitate to ask for help.
