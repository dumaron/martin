This time I want you to create a new flow page, aimed at allowing reading tasks and performing simple manipulation on them.
The first manipulation is that it should be possible to mark a task as done. Please do not forget to add a button to do this.
Then it should be possible to create tasks, so I'd like to have a form on the top of the page for that.
The page should be named "Simple tasks", put under the flow category in the side menu.
Please keep it visually similar to ther pages, like `/projects` page.
Please do not write any test for it, we'll do that later.
